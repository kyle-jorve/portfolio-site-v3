		"content": "<p class=\"largeText\">Illustrator and designer Kyle Jorve has always been enamored of stories of fantasy and science fiction.</p><p>This comes across in his work today in contrasting brushstrokes of vibrant color and depictions of original characters teeming with history and detail, as exemplified in pieces such as <a href=\"/portfolio/detail/?piece=becoming-eidolon\">Becoming Eidolon</a>, <a href=\"/portfolio/detail/?piece=berned\">Berned</a>, and <a href=\"/portfolio/detail/?piece=crows\">Crows</a>.</p><p>As a teenager, Jorve taught himself the medium of digital painting and fell in love with it. Not long after that, his paintings began to grow into universes of their own and inspire the works of fiction that he continues to write today.</p><p>Currently, Jorve works as a front end developer for a Tucson-based digital marketing company. In his free time he writes and illustrates his colorful worlds into life.</p>"
